Logistics management is a crucial aspect of the supply chain that involves planning, 
implementing, and controlling the efficient movement and storage of goods, services, and 
information from point of origin to point of consumption. It encompasses a range of 
activities including transportation, warehousing, inventory management, order 
fulfilment, and distribution, all aimed at optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. From 
real-time tracking and predictive analytics to automated warehousing and intelligent 
transportation systems, these technological advancements are reshaping how logistics 
functions are executed and managed. They provide businesses with the tools to make 
data-driven decisions, anticipate disruptions, and deliver faster, more reliable services. 
As we delve into the impact of technology integration on logistics management, it 
becomes evident that embracing these innovations is not just about staying current but 
about gaining a strategic edge in an increasingly complex and competitive environment.
